`redux-little-router` Experiments - Immutable/Tree Shaking Edition
==================================================================

## Getting started

```sh
$ yarn
$ yarn build
```

## Background

RLR issue https://github.com/FormidableLabs/redux-little-router/issues/261 notes that version `v14.3.0` which introduced `immutable` has the following problems:

- `immutable` fails on import (by design) and creates a build warning, which can fail some CIs.
- If a dev task includes `immutable`, then that gets **added** to the bundle.

This shouldn't be happening, at least not the second part, as tree-shaking should remove everything.

## Experiment

One webpack build, no babel, just a simple import in two forms:

```js
// one-off-import.js
import routerForBrowser from 'redux-little-router/es/environment/browser-router';

console.log("TODO HERE", routerForBrowser);
```

```js
// root-import.js
import { routerForBrowser } from 'redux-little-router';

console.log("TODO HERE", routerForBrowser);
```

These **should** be identical when run through a fully production webpack config. But they're **not**. Tree-shaking just **doesn't work** on `root-import.js` and it exhibits the bad behavior documented above. Looking to `yarn build` output below, `one-off-import.js` is a slim `115 kB` while `root-import.js` ends up with `354 kB` if `immutable` isn't anywhere installed and a whopping `499 kB` if it is!

`one-off-import.js` stays small and does the correct thing no matter what.

## Current Working Output
